## Overview

### The challenge

Refactor a provided starter code to make it more accessible

### User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT we increase the search engine optimization

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS selectors
- Remove repeating selectors and attributes
- Comments

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn about semantic html markups such as ``<header>`` and ``<navigation>``
I also learned and applied keeping CSS selectors and attributes dry by reducing duplicates. 
I enjoyed seeing how my code affected, or did not affect, the rendered file. 

### Continued development

I think I have a pretty good grasp of semantic html elements and CSS selectors and attributes, but I would like to further develop my skills in CSS. There are so many attributes to play around with each having its own syntax. I would also like to understand markdown language; the portability of markdown seems valuable to learn. 

### Useful resources

- [W3school- HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - W3school gave examples as they described html elements which helped visualize the code.
- [W3school- CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This provided an in-depth yet easy to access guide to CSS elements. 
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This was a great guide to dive into markdown
- [GIT Guide](https://github.com/git-guides) - This guide helped me get through creating repositories, cloning and pushing codes.
